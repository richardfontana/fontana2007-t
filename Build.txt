To build Kojo from source, you need to do the following:

- Clone the Kojo Mercurial repo. This will give you a local Kojo source tree.
  Let's call the location of this tree $kojo

- Download and install Netbeans 6.8M2. This step is required because Kojo is
  a Netbeans Platform application, and depends on Netbeans Platforms jars for
  things like Window-System and Code-Editor functionality.
  As beta, release canditate, and the final versions of Netbeans 6.8 are released,
  Kojo will be updated to support them.

- Download and install Ant 1.7.1 or later

- Download and install Scala. This involves having scala on your path, and having
  SCALA_HOME pointing to your Scala install dir.
  The currently supported version of Scala is: version 2.8.0.r18997-b20091009021954.
  As beta, release canditate, and the final versions of Scala 2.8 are released,
  Kojo will be updated to support them.
  The above Scala version can be downloaded from: http://www.scala-lang.org/node/212/distributions
 
- Fire up Netbeans and open the Kojo project located at $kojo. This is a one-time
  operation that will update the build script to point to your Netbeans location.

- Go into $kojo and run 'ant build' to build Kojo, and then 'ant run' to run it.


Using different versions of Netbeans and Scala
----------------------------------------------
The above build instructions should work just fine with:

- Versions of Netbeans later than 6.8M2

- A more recent Scala nightly build (than 2.8.0.r18997-b20091009021954).
  If you get a newer nightly build, you will need to update the Scala library
  and compiler jars located at: $kojo/Scala-2.8/release/modules/ext
  The one thing that might break with a newer build is - the tests
  that depend on Scalacheck (because of potential binary incompatibility)
