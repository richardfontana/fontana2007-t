To build Kojo from source, you need to do the following:

- Clone the Kojo Mercurial repo. This will give you a local Kojo source tree.
  Let's call the location of this tree $kojo

- Download and install Netbeans 6.8M2. This step is required because Kojo is
  a Netbeans Platform application, and depends on Netbeans Platforms jars for
  things like Window-System and Code-Editor functionality.

- Download and install Ant 1.7.1 or later

- Download and install Scala. This involves having scala on your path, and having
  SCALA_HOME pointing to your Scala install dir.
  The currently supported version of Scala is: version 2.8.0.r18997-b20091009021954.
  As beta and release canditate versions of Scala 2.8 are released, Kojo will be
  updated to support these versions.

- Fire up Netbeans and open the Kojo project located at $kojo. This is a one-time
  operation that will update the build script to point to your Netbeans location.

- Go into $kojo and run ant build to build Kojo, and ant run to run it.
